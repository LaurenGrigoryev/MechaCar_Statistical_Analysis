## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
[Output pictured here]<https://github.com/LaurenSonis/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/2021-03-21.png>
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Ground_clearance and vehicle_length (as well as the intercept) were the variables that provided a non-random amount of variance. 

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11, significantly smaller than 0.05.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the multiple R-squared value is 71%, meaning about 71 percent of the time the mpg values will be correct.
